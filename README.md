## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) 8.0 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/examflow.git
cd examflow
```

### 2. Configure the backend environment

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a file named `.env` with the following content:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=online_exam_portal
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```

> **Note:** Replace `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL root password.  
> `JWT_SECRET` can be any long random string — keep it secret.

### 3. Install backend dependencies

```bash
# inside the backend/ folder
npm install
```

### 4. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 5. Start the backend server

```bash
# inside the backend/ folder
node index.js
```

Or with auto-reload on file changes:

```bash
npx nodemon index.js
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:5000**.  
On first run it automatically creates the `online_exam_portal` database and all required tables — no manual SQL needed.

### 6. Start the frontend dev server

Open a new terminal:

```bash
# inside the frontend/ folder
npm run dev
```

The app opens at **http://localhost:5173**.

## Creating the First Admin Account

Public registration only creates student accounts. To create an admin account, insert one directly into the database:

```sql
-- First register normally through the UI, then promote the user:
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

Or insert directly:

```sql
-- Password below is bcrypt hash of "admin123" — change it after first login
INSERT INTO users (name, username, email, password, role)
VALUES (
  'Admin User',
  'admin',
  'admin@examflow.com',
  '$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lHHG',
  'admin'
);
```

Then log in with `admin@examflow.com` / `admin123` and change your password from the Profile page.

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with **bcryptjs** (salt rounds: 10) — never stored in plain text
- Exam scores are calculated **server-side** — correct answers are never sent to the browser
- JWT tokens expire after **1 day**
- Admin role cannot be self-assigned through registration — requires direct DB update
- CORS is currently open (`*`) — restrict `origin` in `backend/index.js` before deploying to production
